    <h2>For You 💌</h2>
    <p>
        I met You online, I saw you as a most energetic human being, The day when I saw your name on the live chat and the way you texted your thoughts,IDK what it made me feel, it forced my mind to talk to you, Soon our destlny paved a way to txt you. You Know these lines by Ed Sheeran "We were just kids when we fell in love, not knowing what it was", it was really me, Exactly me, i was not knowing what it was when i fell for you ! I never saw you in my life time but somehow i fell for you, Later we texted a lot, I came to know about everything you were facing then, Literally i was on shock, i admired your postive vibes and energetic txts but deep down you were dying both mentally and physically. IDK what to do, I was not in any position to do anything. But i made up myslef to an emotional support of thulasi M.R.THULASI. I was thinking to make your forget about everything happening to you around, i understood your needs, i realised your taste. To make one to forget about reality we should make them to think only about their favourite things so i planned to make you happy. I was not the most fav person of yours back then. But i know you like movies and series kinda stuff. From your mouth i got to know you like Harry Potter very much so we started watch harry potter IDK if i my plan worked or not but i had a small satisfaction that i made forget about every bad things happening around you. From the day i realised about your sad part i pledged myself to you happy No matter what happens i should never let you down, I should never hurt you ,you should never make you think that you are alone ,i should be sticking to your side forever ne solluviye Gum potu ottunamaaari..athuthaaa.. I wanted to be your emotional support. IDK how but my pledge acted as an enchantment and now i got you, I GOT THULASI, I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE I GOT THULASI!!!!. The day we confessed our feelings everything i thought of during the COVID prd Flashed inside my brain. I have no words to say how blessed i am to get THULASI as my girlfriend. I never dreamt of making you my girlfriend. The way you speak and your hopes made me to have a strong belief that you won't love me. But it happened THULASI LOVES ME. OMGG is this even real! I was not attracted by your looks back then i was i attracted by the character of yours. your loyalty on LOVE. Atha Loyalty nu solratha illa unoda true feelings nu solrathaa nu therilaa but, i was attracted to it. iva en post marathuku thani uuthura nu yosichiruken. But then when i came to know how beautiful you are i fell once again. i keep on fallng for you by your looks, your character, your voice, your way of speech, your boldness, your body language etc...etc...etcc...i really want to make this promise "From Pimles to wrinkles" to be true. I promise you, I won't leave you at anycost please don't leave me, you how i will be if you leave me.so please don't leave alone. I LOVVVEEE YOOOUUU THULASI❤️, BE MY GIRLFRIEND😩, BE MY FIANCE🥺, BE MY WIFE💑.COMPANY ME TILL MY GRAVE🪦!!! WILL YOUUU???💍
